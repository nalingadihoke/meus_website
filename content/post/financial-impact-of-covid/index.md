As part of Prof. Wang's team, one of my first major tasks was to automate the extraction of bankruptcy data, for the duration of the pandemic, using a web scraper. Selenium Webdriver API and Beautiful Soup, both were used to scrape the [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/) website for Chapter 11, 13, 12 and 7 bankruptcy data. My primary work now is on data management using dask for parallel computing to index millions of transaction data points in pandas.

Since it is ongoing research I can't go into more detail; check out my other [projects](https://www.nalingadihoke.com/#projects).
